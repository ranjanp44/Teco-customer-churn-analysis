# Teco-customer-churn-analysis
# Objective:
 The analysis explores customer churn patterns, focusing on various factors such as payment
 methods, contract types, tenure, and demographic attributes. The goal is to identify which
 factors are most strongly associated with higher churn rates to guide customer retention
 strategies.
 
# Key Insights & Findings:

● Contract Type and Churn:

 ○ Customers on month-to-month contracts exhibit the highest churn rate, with
 42% of such customers likely to churn.
 
 ○ Incontrast, customers on one-year and two-year contracts have churn rates of
 11% and 3%, respectively.
 
 ○ Implication: Longer contract periods serve as a strong retention tool, as
 customers with extended commitments are far less likely to leave.
 
 ● PaymentMethods and Churn:
 
 ○ Customers paying via electronic checks show the highest churn rate at 45%,
 while those using credit cards, bank transfers, or mailed checks have
 significantly lower churn rates, averaging around 15-18%.
 
 ○ Implication: The convenience, security, and trust issues related to electronic
 payments might be contributing factors. Encouraging customers to switch to
 more stable payment methods could reduce churn.
 
 ● Churn byTenure:
 
 ○ Customers with less than one year of tenure are the most likely to churn, with a
 50% churn rate. Those with 1-3 years of tenure show a decreasing churn trend
 at 35%, while customers who have been with the company for more than three
 years have a churn rate of just 15%.
 ○ Implication: Engaging customers early in their journey, especially within the first
 year, is critical for retention.
 
 ● ChurnbyInternet Service Type:
 
 ○ Customers using Fiber Optic services show a higher churn rate of 30%,
 compared to DSL customers with a churn rate of 20%.
 ○ Implication: This could be due to increased competition or dissatisfaction with
 service quality. Understanding customer satisfaction with service speed and
 reliability may help retain fiber optic users.
 
 ● Senior Citizens and Churn:
 
 ○ Theanalysis reveals that senior citizens (aged 65+) have a churn rate of 41%,
 compared to a 26% churn rate among non-senior citizens.
 ○ Implication: Special retention programs and targeted customer service for senior
 customers may help reduce churn in this demographic.
 
 # Visualizations & Data Insights:
 
 ● BarCharts and Line Graphs:
 
 ○ Thevisual representation of churn by payment method clearly shows that
 customers using electronic checks churn almost three times as much as those
 using more traditional or secure methods like credit cards.
 
 ○ Customertenure vs. churn rate visualizations reveal a clear declining trend in
 churn as customers' tenure increases, underscoring the need for early-stage
 customer loyalty programs.
 
 ● Percentage Distribution of Churn Across Factors:
 
 ○ PaymentMethods: 45% churn for electronic check users, 15% for credit card
 users.
 
○ Contract Types: 42% churn for month-to-month contracts, 11% for yearly
 contracts, 3% for two-year contracts.
 
 ○ Tenure: 50% churn in the first year, dropping to 15% after three years.
 
# Recommendations:
 
 ● PromoteLong-Term Contracts: Offer incentives for customers to commit to longer
 contracts to reduce churn.
 
 ● AddressPayment Method Concerns: Implement campaigns encouraging customers
 to switch from electronic checks to more reliable payment methods.
 
 ● CustomerEngagement in Early Tenure: Focus on improving the customer experience
 within the first year, as churn is highest in this period.
 
 ● Special Senior Citizen Retention Programs: Create personalized offers or assistance
 programs to retain the senior demographic.
